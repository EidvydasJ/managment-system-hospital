# Simple Hospital Management System

## Overview
This hospital management system is a Python program designed to help manage patient and doctor rosters, manage visits and inventory in a hospital environment. It includes functions for planning visits, managing information about patients and doctors, and managing the inventory of medical tools and equipment.

## Features
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Schedule appointments between patients and doctors.
- **Patient and Doctor Management:** Add, view, and manage patient and doctor information.
- **Inventory Management:** Add, view, update, and search items in the hospital's inventory.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Pillars
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction
4. Polimorphism

## Design patterns
1. „Factory method“
2. „Observer pattern“

## Why these patterns?
- **„Factory method“:** When you need to create/add a person, that is, a patient, a doctor, it is very easy to do this using the Factory method. I liked this method and it is wonderful, because when creating a person, it is not necessary to create an object for the corresponding class and assign all the information - everything is much simpler. Based on the type of person (patient or doctor), Factory creates a person with the information assigned to it.
- **„Observer pattern“:** A model that, most likely, was not shown during the lectures, but it was perfect for implementing my idea - to announce some changes. It could be the registration of a new visit, it could be the "arrival" of new tools, it could be the search for an object in the inventory or updating the contents of the storage.
